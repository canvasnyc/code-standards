## 1. General Principles

* HTML is content-driven markup language. The elements being used should reflect the content, its intention and its behavior as much as possible.
* Use soft-tabs with a two space indent. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any personâ€™s environment.
* Paragraphs of text should always be placed in a <p> tag. Never use multiple <br> tags.
* Items in list form should always be in <ul>, <ol>, or <dl>. Never use a set of <div> or <p>.
* Do not use closing slashs on self closing elements: `<br>, <hr>, <img>`

## 2. HTML 5

* Always use the HTML5 doctype: `<!doctype html>`
* Use HTML5 semantic elements when appropriate. If in doubt, refer to [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/element-index/) for a description of elements.
* Use section and article tags based on correct semantics and never interchangeably.

## 3. Layout

* Use HTML5 elements, and generic `<div>`s for layout.
* Do not use tables for anything that isn't tabular data.
* Take advantage of the default behavior of generic `<div>` and `<span>` elements (i.e., don't put `display: inline` on a `div` and don't put `display: block` on a `span`). Likewise, don't redeclare these values.
* Always consider the responsive behavior and flow of elements when structuring markup. Not even CSS can override the order of HTML elements.

## 4. Accessibility

* Only use image replacement when absolutely necessary.
* Always include labels on form elements (even if they need to be hidden).
* Wrap radios, checkboxes and their text in labels.
* Include a `tabindex` attribute on all form elements.
* When possible adjust for visually impaired users: [testing tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/NoCoffee%20Vision%20Simulator?hl=en&gl=US).
* Only add a new tag when absolutely necessary or required by semantics to avoid over-nesting.
* Make important hidden text available to screen readers.

<a name="seo"></a>
## 5. SEO

* Use `alt` attributes on all images.
* Never use images in place of important text.
* Always print out hidden text inside elements that use image replacement.
* Use `title` attributes on all links.
* Be sure to include a live text `h1` tag on every page with relavant contextual copy.
* Do not wrap important content inside JS (exceptions based on framework).
* Always include a relavant `title` meta tag.
* When formatting title meta tags always include the site name after the page description, not before. `<meta name="title" content="Contact Us | Canvas">`
* Always include a relavant `desc` meta tag.
* When necessary use [schema](http://schema.org/) to enhance SEO.

## 6. Attributes

* Add attributes in a consistent order to improve readability.
```
<a href="link-1" id="id-1" class="class-1" title="title-1">Link 1</a>
<a href="link-2" id="id-2" class="class-2" title="title-2">Link 2</a>

a#id-1.class-1 href="link-1" title="title-1"
a#id-2.class-2 href="link-2" title="title-2"
```
