## Principles

> "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that
  writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using
  your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal
  preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit

* Strive to create loosely coupled, highly reusable code.
* Always keep extensibility in mind.
* Maintain code that is easy read and understand.
* All code in any code-base should look like a single person wrote it, even on a team 
  with many contributors.
* When trying to fix an issue, consider removing code before adding to it.
* It is important to strictly enforce the agreed-upon standards.
* Carefully re-evaluate these standards when better systems and conventions are available.
* If it is not possible to defend and support a standard, it should be removed.
